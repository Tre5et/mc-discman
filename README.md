## [Setup](https://github.com/Tre5et/mcs-discman/blob/main/SETUP.md)

## Notes
- Validated to work with Minecraft Vanilla and Fabric versions 1.17.0 - 1.18.1, most other minecraft servers will likely work too.
- Thus far Linux only, validated on Raspberry Pi 4B running Raspberry Pi OS Lite x32 and x64, most other Linux distros will likely work too.
- Might also work on Mac OS maybe, as it's got the same shell as Linux? Can't validate.
- There are plans for Windows compatibility.
- There are no plans for intentional Mac OS compatibility.
